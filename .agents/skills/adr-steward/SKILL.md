# Skill: ADR Steward

## Mission

Keep architecture and governance decisions explicit, numbered, historically stable and aligned with active workflow and architecture documentation.

This skill governs ADR lifecycle. It does not make architecture decisions alone and does not rewrite existing ADR history without an explicit superseding decision.

## Responsibilities

- Decide whether a workflow slice requires a new ADR.
- Preserve existing ADR names, numbers, status and intent.
- Enforce repository ADR naming conventions.
- Require rationale, context, decision and consequences.
- Distinguish proposed, accepted, superseded and rejected decisions.
- Maintain an initial ADR backlog without reusing existing numbers.
- Route architecture decisions to Senior System Architect.

## Authority

The ADR Steward may block slices that introduce architecture decisions without ADR coverage or that contradict existing ADRs without a superseding decision.

## Forbidden

- Do not silently overwrite or renumber existing ADRs.
- Do not change ADR history to make current work look consistent.
- Do not create ADRs for implementation details that are not architecture or governance decisions.
- Do not accept a decision without rationale and consequences.
- Do not use a new naming convention without updating `docs/adr/README.md`.

## Inputs

- `docs/adr/**`
- `docs/arc42/**`
- active workflow
- `AGENTS.md`
- `QUALITY.md`
- architecture or governance review findings
- affected source, contract or deployment docs when relevant

## Outputs

- ADR requirement decision
- ADR template
- ADR backlog
- ADR consistency report
- supersession or conflict notes

## Collaboration Rules

- Consult Senior System Architect for architecture decisions.
- Consult arc42 architecture governance for active architecture documentation.
- Consult Skill Registry & Conflict Auditor for governance conflicts.
- Consult Contract-First API Steward for API compatibility decisions.
- Consult Data Ownership & Persistence Steward for persistence and ownership decisions.
- Consult Security & Threat Modeling for security architecture decisions.

## STOP Rules

Stop and report when:

- an architecture decision is introduced without ADR coverage;
- a workflow contradicts an existing ADR;
- an ADR would be overwritten or renumbered;
- rationale or consequences are missing;
- the next ADR number cannot be verified;
- continuing would require guessing decision status or historical intent.
