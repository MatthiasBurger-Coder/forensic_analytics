# Skill: Workflow Authoring

## Purpose

Create executable, repository-specific workflows that preserve `AGENTS.md`, `QUALITY.md`, architecture governance, requirement traceability and evidence integrity.

This skill governs workflow creation. It does not implement runtime business functionality.

## Requirement Clarification Gate

Before workflow authoring, run the `workflow create` requirement clarification loop.

Record:

- Original Request
- Interpreted Intent
- Change Type
- Affected Process Strand
- Affected Architecture Area
- Explicit Requirements
- Implicit Requirements
- Assumptions
- Non-Goals
- Risks
- Open Questions
- Blocking Questions
- Confidence Level
- Decision: `READY_FOR_WORKFLOW`, `PROCEED_WITH_ACCEPTED_ASSUMPTIONS` or `REQUIRES_REFINEMENT`

Confidence greater than or equal to 90 percent may be `READY_FOR_WORKFLOW` when no blocking questions remain. Confidence from 70 to 89 percent may be `PROCEED_WITH_ACCEPTED_ASSUMPTIONS` only when every assumption is non-blocking and documented. Confidence below 70 percent is `REQUIRES_REFINEMENT`.

Blocking questions prevent final workflow authoring and release for `workflow execute`.

Automatic clarification loops are capped at `maxRetries = 3`. After the third unresolved attempt, stop workflow authoring, keep the decision at `REQUIRES_REFINEMENT`, and escalate to the Root Architect with the unresolved blockers.

`workflow create` must use five mandatory roles:

- Senior Requirement Engineer
- Senior System Architect
- Senior Java Backend Developer
- Senior React Frontend Developer
- Senior Tester

Classic labels such as Requirement Analyst, Architecture Validator and Quality Validator are optional perspectives. They do not replace the five mandatory roles.

## Mandatory Branch-First Rule

Every workflow creation must start by ensuring a dedicated Git branch for that workflow exists and is active.

For a new workflow this means creating and checking out a workflow branch before mutating workflow artifacts. If the current branch already exactly matches the current workflow, verify it before continuing.

Read-only verification, requirement intake, routing-rule inspection, and role selection may occur before branch creation. Mutating workflow creation must not.

This rule applies before any workflow artifact is created or modified: `workflow.md`, `docs/workflow/**`, workplans, slice definitions, workflow-specific documentation changes, implementation tasks, or write-capable agent assignments.

Required order:

1. Verify the Git repository context.
2. Check the working tree status.
3. Stop if the current branch is detached, unclear, or if unrelated or unclear uncommitted changes exist.
4. Create a dedicated workflow branch, unless the current branch already matches the current workflow.
5. Check local and remote branch-name collisions, choosing the next clear unique suffix when needed.
6. Checkout the workflow branch, or verify the existing matching workflow branch.
7. Verify that the local branch ref exists.
8. Verify the active branch.
9. Create or regenerate workflow artifacts only after successful branch verification.
10. Continue with slices, subagents, quality gates, commits, and optional push.

Default branch naming:

```text
feature/workflow-<short-topic>-<yyyyMMdd>
fix/workflow-<short-topic>-<yyyyMMdd>
docs/workflow-<short-topic>-<yyyyMMdd>
architecture/workflow-<short-topic>-<yyyyMMdd>
```

Never create or modify workflow artifacts on `main`, `master`, `develop`, or any shared branch. If branch creation, checkout or verification fails, stop and report the reason instead of continuing in the current branch.

Branch verification after creation or checkout must include both:

```bash
git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/<workflow-branch>
git branch --show-current
```

Do not rely on generated workflow notes as proof that a branch exists.

## Required Inputs

Read before authoring or regenerating a workflow:

1. User request.
2. Root `AGENTS.md`.
3. Root `QUALITY.md`.
4. Existing `docs/workflow` if present.
5. Relevant EPIC files under `docs/epics`.
6. Relevant `docs/arc42` and `docs/adr` files.
7. Relevant `.agents/skills` and `.agents/roles` files.
8. Build or CI files only when quality-gate behavior is affected.

## Workflow Regeneration Rule

Before creating a new workflow:

1. Verify the repository root and the absolute target path.
2. Verify that the dedicated workflow branch exists and is active.
3. Delete `docs/workflow` completely, unless the user explicitly asks to preserve an existing workflow.
4. Recreate `docs/workflow`.
5. Regenerate the full workflow structure.

Do not partially overwrite old slices. Do not keep stale workflow files unless the user explicitly asks to archive them outside the active workflow.

## Workflow Structure

Every workflow should include:

- Executive Summary
- Target Picture
- verified baseline
- target outcome
- Scope
- explicit non-goals
- architecture constraints
- Backend Assessment
- Frontend Assessment
- Test Strategy
- resilience requirements
- ordered slices
- slice dependency graph
- parallelization opportunities
- role or subagent ownership map
- quality-gate expectations from `QUALITY.md`
- documentation synchronization points
- stop conditions
- uncertainty escalation rules
- commit and push plan when requested
- Definition of Done
- Handoff to workflow execute
- arc42 Check Status

Workflow creation is complete only when both of these artifacts have been checked:

1. complete checked `docs/workflow/workflow.md`
2. checked or updated `docs/arc42/**` documentation

## Slice Rules

Use stable two-digit slice numbers:

```text
Slice 01
Slice 02
Slice 03
```

For each slice define:

- purpose
- prerequisites
- affected files
- owner role
- allowed write scope
- dependencies
- parallelization status
- done criteria
- verification commands
- stop conditions

Parallelize only when write scopes are disjoint, shared contracts are stable and verification can be run independently.

## Subagent Assignment

Assign roles by verified responsibility:

- workflow creation and dependency ordering: Senior Workflow Architect
- requirement and EPIC drift: Senior Requirement Engineer
- architecture boundaries and arc42: Senior System Architect or arc42 governance
- documentation consistency: Senior Documentation Engineer
- quality verification: Senior Tester or quality-gate skills
- branch, commit and push readiness: git commit preparation skills

Use subagents only when the user explicitly asks for delegated or parallel agent work.

Subagents must verify that the active branch belongs to the current workflow before modifying files. They must not switch branches or implement on `main`, `master`, `develop`, or any shared branch unless the workflow explicitly authorizes the branch operation.

## Quality Gates

Read `QUALITY.md` before documenting quality commands.

Do not invent Gradle task names, CI jobs or quality scripts. If a command cannot be verified, stop and report.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and report if:

- the Git repository context cannot be verified
- the current branch is detached or unclear
- unrelated or unclear uncommitted changes exist before workflow branch creation
- the branch name collides with an existing local or remote branch and no clear unique suffix can be chosen
- the dedicated workflow branch cannot be created, checked out, verified as a local ref, or verified as active
- the active branch is `main`, `master`, `develop`, or another shared branch when workflow files would be created
- `docs/workflow` cannot be safely deleted and regenerated
- architecture conflicts are unclear
- EPIC contradicts implementation and the source of truth is unclear
- multiple active workflows conflict
- service ownership is ambiguous
- resilience expectations are unclear
- quality-gate authority is unclear
- planned file paths cannot be verified
- blocking requirement questions remain
- `docs/workflow/workflow.md` cannot be validated
- arc42 documentation cannot be checked or updated
- continuing would require guessing governance decisions

## Expected Outputs

- fully regenerated `docs/workflow`
- ordered slice plan
- dependency graph or dependency summary
- role ownership map
- verification plan
- documented assumptions and unresolved conflicts
