# Testing Strategy

## Purpose

Define test coverage for small slices without weakening repository quality rules.

## Practices

- Use regression-first workflow for bug fixes.
- Prefer narrow tests for small changes and broader tests for shared contracts.
- Keep integration tests deterministic and isolated from external services by default.
- Verify forensic semantics: provenance, ordering, explicit gaps and evidence categories.
- Use temporary directories and synthetic fixtures in tests.

## Verification

- Run targeted tests first.
- Run `./gradlew test --dependency-verification strict --console=plain --stacktrace` for shared behavior.
- Run the full gate from `QUALITY.md` for commit readiness.
