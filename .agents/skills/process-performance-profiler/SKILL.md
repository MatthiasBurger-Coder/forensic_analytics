# Skill: Process Performance Profiler

## Mission

Record process-performance diagnostics for governed workflow execution so
future optimization work is evidence-based. Metrics are operational
diagnostics only. They are not proof of correctness and must never replace
required role reviews, STOP rules, S3/S3D checks, D8 quality decisions or
`QUALITY.md` commands.

## Responsibilities

- Record time spent in requirement gates, branch preflight, S3/S3D,
  implementation or documentation slices, quality gates, commit preparation
  and checkpoint push.
- Count roles or local role-review checklists invoked.
- Count files read when the executor can track that count without unsafe
  instrumentation.
- Count quality commands run and classify them as targeted, required or full.
- Record repeated reads of `AGENTS.md`, `QUALITY.md`, routing rules, workflow
  files, context packs and skill registry files.
- Record retry count by Typed Error Router category.
- Record blocker count and blocker category.
- Identify the longest critical path from available slice timing and
  dependency information.
- Record parallelization opportunities not used and the reason, such as file
  lock overlap, architecture lock overlap, missing metadata or quality-gate
  attribution risk.
- Write metrics only under `docs/workflow/metrics/**`.

## Forbidden

- Do not record secrets, credentials, tokens, personal data, raw evidence
  payloads, prompt content, source-code excerpts or runtime trace payloads.
- Do not block required quality gates to collect metrics.
- Do not mark a slice, workflow, commit, push or release as correct because a
  metric looks healthy.
- Do not introduce telemetry services, external dependencies, background
  agents or build plugins.
- Do not execute product code, parser code, Joern, BTM, replay, graph or UI
  performance tests from this process profiler.

## Inputs

- active workflow version and slice metadata
- execution report
- S3/S3D results
- role-review or subagent routing notes
- quality-gate command evidence
- checkpoint commit and push outcomes
- Typed Error Router retry and blocker records

## Output Location

Write run reports under:

```text
docs/workflow/metrics/<workflow-id>-run.md
```

Use stable identifiers and summarize measurements. Do not include raw command
logs when a short command name, duration and result are enough.

## Minimum Report Fields

Each run report should include:

```text
workflowVersion
workflowBranch
runDate
executionProfile
sliceCount
rolesInvoked
filesRead
qualityCommandsRun
repeatedGovernanceReads
typedErrorRetries
blockerCount
longestCriticalPath
parallelizationOpportunitiesNotUsed
diagnosticLimitations
```

## STOP Rules

Stop and report when:

- collecting a metric would require recording secrets, prompt content or raw
  forensic evidence payloads;
- metrics would delay, skip, downgrade or replace a required D8 quality gate;
- a requested metric would require executing untrusted repository code;
- a report would present process speed or low retry count as proof of product,
  workflow or evidence correctness.
