# Routing Rules

Use these rules to select roles for a slice. Prefer the smallest set that covers the actual files and risks.

## Role Routing

## Exact Command Routing

- Exact `skills update` routes to the skills-agents strand, Skill Registry Conflict Auditor, Senior Documentation Engineer, Organigramm Maintainer, and Process Governance Maintainer.
- Exact `workflow create` routes to workflow create.
- Exact `workflow execute` routes to workflow execute.

Before assigning specialist roles, route every `workflow create` and
`workflow execute` request through
`skills/execution-profile-router/SKILL.md`.

The selected execution profile decides which gates are mandatory, which role
reviews are full reviews, and which reviews may be reduced to N/A impact
checks. Profile routing must not bypass root `AGENTS.md`, `QUALITY.md`, ADRs,
active workflow STOP rules, Five-Role Three Amigos participation, S3/S3D
preflight, Typed Error Router ownership, branch rules, or required quality
gates. Unclear impact defaults to `FULL_PATH`.

- Backend domain, application, persistence, static analysis, runtime ingestion, gRPC or Protobuf work routes to `roles/senior-java-backend.md`.
- Source-code creation, large-class rework, method extraction, mapper extraction, persistence-adapter decomposition, endpoint decomposition, declarative-before-imperative redesign, Strategy Pattern introduction or IF-less responsibility cleanup also routes to `skills/source-code-responsibility/SKILL.md` alongside the owning technical role.
- React, frontend state, API client integration or UI component work routes to `roles/senior-react-frontend.md`.
- Information architecture, accessibility, visualization UX or user-flow work routes to `roles/senior-ux-designer.md`.
- Cross-module design, package boundaries, architecture tests, or module restructuring routes to `roles/senior-system-architect.md`.
- Microservice boundaries, service autonomy, independent deployability, or no-shared-code service reviews route to `roles/microservice-senior-expert.md`.
- Bounded-context service decomposition and "technical module is not a microservice" decision route to `skills/service-decomposition-bounded-context/SKILL.md`.
- Cross-service Logging, REST/OpenAPI, gRPC/protobuf, or event contract governance routes to `skills/contract-governance-expert/SKILL.md`.
- Production microservice migration safety, rollback, strangler strategy or multiservice risk gates route to `skills/microservice-migration-safety-gate/SKILL.md`.
- Microservice runtime independence, health check, observability, or container-readiness evidence routes to `skills/microservice-runtime-readiness-expert/SKILL.md`.
- Test strategy, regression coverage, ArchUnit, or coverage-gate design routes to `roles/senior-tester.md`.
- Quality or validation failures in `workflow execute` route through the Typed Error Router before any retry:
  - `ARCH_VIOLATION` routes to Root Architect escalation, `roles/senior-system-architect.md` and `skills/architecture-hexagonal/SKILL.md`.
  - `BUILD_FAILURE` routes to the responsible backend or frontend owner plus `roles/senior-devops.md`; Gradle-specific failures also route to `skills/build-gradle/SKILL.md`.
  - `TEST_FAILURE` routes to `roles/senior-tester.md` and the responsible slice agent.
  - `DOC_GOVERNANCE_FAILURE` routes to `roles/senior-documentation-engineer.md` and `roles/senior-requirement-engineer/SKILL.md`.
  - `LOCK_CONFLICT` routes to `roles/senior-execution-orchestrator.md`, `skills/s3d-execution-orchestrator/SKILL.md`, Senior Swarm Orchestrator coordination and Root Architect escalation.
  - `UNKNOWN_FAILURE` routes to Root Architect escalation.
- Gradle, Docker, Kubernetes, CI, observability, or deployment work routes to `roles/senior-devops.md`.
- New workflow creation, full `docs/workflow` regeneration, slice dependency planning or planning-risk review routes to `roles/senior-workflow-architect/SKILL.md`.
- EPIC consistency, requirement drift, requirement classification, assumption tracking or requirement-to-architecture synchronization routes to `roles/senior-requirement-engineer/SKILL.md`.
- Incoming requirement gatekeeping before workflow authoring, Three Amigos review, acceptance-criteria validation, dependency/deadlock checks, or `READY_FOR_WORKFLOW` versus `REQUIRES_REFINEMENT` decisions route to `skills/three-amigos-requirement-gatekeeper/SKILL.md`.
- Multi-role coordination, conflict resolution, or slice planning routes to `roles/senior-swarm-orchestrator.md`.
- S3D execution orchestration, dependency graph construction, topological sorting, parallelization grouping, or file/contract/module/architecture-boundary conflict locks route to `roles/senior-execution-orchestrator.md` and `skills/s3d-execution-orchestrator/SKILL.md`.
- Protobuf contracts, streaming RPC design, request validation, or gRPC compatibility route to `roles/senior-grpc-proto-specialist.md`.
- Repository checkout, workspace lifecycle, source-root preparation, or large Git repositories route to `roles/senior-git-workspace-specialist.md`.
- Plugin producer handoff, plugin-side request construction, or plugin-to-server communication routes to `roles/senior-plugin-integration-developer.md`.
- Documentation, skill-audit material, existing workflow updates or ADR alignment notes route to `roles/senior-documentation-engineer.md`.
- Untrusted repository handling, sandboxing, safe Git operations, or secret leakage risks route to `roles/senior-security-sandbox-engineer.md`.
- Performance budgets, large repository metrics, timeouts, quotas, or scalability testing route to `roles/senior-performance-engineer.md`.
- Analysis-session storage, raw ingestion storage, artifact storage, or projection boundaries route to `roles/senior-analysis-storage-architect.md`.
- Joern, Code Property Graph, semantic artifact handling, or CPG large-project planning route to `roles/senior-joern-cpg-specialist.md`.
- Root Architect escalation routes to `roles/root-architect.md`. Senior System
  Architect remains the architecture-governance specialist and collaborates on
  architecture-sensitive escalation decisions.
- Rollback governance routes to `skills/release-branch-governance/SKILL.md`,
  `skills/git-commit-preparation/SKILL.md` and `roles/senior-devops.md`.
- Quality gate classification routes to
  `skills/quality-gate-orchestrator/SKILL.md`, `skills/quality-gate/SKILL.md`
  and `roles/senior-tester.md`.
- Flowchart integrity audit routes to
  `skills/flowchart-integrity-auditor/SKILL.md`; Senior Documentation
  Engineer owns documentation synchronization and Senior System Architect owns
  architecture-governance escalation when the auditor reports a blocker.

## Escalation

Stop and report when a required file, task, symbol, schema, command, or contract cannot be verified exactly.

Use `QUALITY.md` for verification commands. Optional external checks such as Sonar require documented credentials and must be reported when skipped.
